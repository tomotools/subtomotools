# subtomotools
Scripts to facilitate STA, interfacing Warp/M, Relion 3.1, TomoTwin and whatever else seems relevant. 

## Functions:
```upgrade-star```: Upgrade Warp-style star to Relion 3.1.4  
```downgrade-star```: Downgrade Relion-3-style star to Warp/M  

```project-particles```: Calculate 2D projections of subtomograms, with or without CTF correction. CTF correction requires CTF volume.  
```apply-subset```: Apply subset of particles from 2D classification to subtomogram star.

```tomotwin2warp```: **not included yet**, will be conversion of a tomotwin-generated coords directory to a Warp-style star
